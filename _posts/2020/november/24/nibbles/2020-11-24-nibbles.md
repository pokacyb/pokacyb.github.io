Today let's try to get in one of the easy boxes at HTB, Nibbles. 


### Start of recon

The first thing we do is create a nmap directory to hold the results. Next run the scan with nmap -sC for default scripts, -sV to enumerate versions, -oA to output all formats. We put it in the nmap directory called initial and we add -vvv to it shows us what port is open as soon as it finds them. To end the command the IP adress of Nibbles which is 10.10.10.75. 

```bash
nmap -sC -oA nmap/initial -vvv 10.10.10.75
```

The scan has come back. Two ports are open, port 80 and port 22.

While setting intercept to off on Burp (we'll come back to it later). Cheking Nibbles's web page, it's a warming "Hello, world!".

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/2-3.png)


### Finding hidden directory via Source

Nibbles is running Apache 2.4.18 on Ubuntu. There is also a comment down that seems to point to the /nibbleblog/ directory. But first we're going to see exactly what this Apache version is. It might be Ubuntu Xenial so lets google it.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/3-1.png)

It is indeed Xenial Apache 2. This doesn't really do us any good right now but that information is always useful to have. Because knowing what distribution can tell us what type of exploits to throw once we get a shell.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/3-2.png)


### Downloading NibbleBlog to help us with finding version information

We just see a page “Powered by Nibbleblog” so the very first thing we are going to do before doing gobust or anything is see if this is like an open-source application.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/4-1.png)

After googling “Nibbleblog" we arrive at the [official website](http://www.nibbleblog.com/fr/). It also was on github but let's just download the lastest version because that way we can see exactly if it's possible to find out how to enumerate what version a software is installed, and see if this is fully up-to-date or not. The actual release can get us better results. Let's move the downloaded file to a working directory and unzip it. We did a recursive greb with -R and 4.0.5 which is the version that we are running and . for the current directory. The string was in quite a few strings so we type this in awk to filter it.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/4-4.png)


### Identifying what version of Nibbleblog is running

Above we piped the result into awk with -F for field separator and we want to separate at ':' and then print $1 to grab the very first match. Piped again to uniq for lisibility. We see that “tinymce” has 4.0.5 but that may just be a font size. Let's inspect the first item, the “admin/boot/rules/98-constants.bit". The Nibbleblog version is indeed 4.0.5.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/5-1.png)

After going to the adress 10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/admin/boot/rules/98-constants.bit we get a blank page but the source code is showing us that php is failing to execude because of the .bit extension. This is not .php, so we can see the source code because the server is not going to execute it. It is running version 4.0.3, name Coffee and last release 2014.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/5-2.png)


### Using SearchSploit to find vulnerabilities

After a SearchSploit to look for potential vulnerabilites we have two differents ones. A file upload and a SQL injection. Let's run searchsploit -m to mirror and then paste in the exploits to copy to a new working directory.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/6-1.png)

35865.txt teaches us that Nibbleblog 3.0 is infected. Since we're running 4.0 this doesn't concern us so let's discard the file.The other one, the metasploit script 38489.rb.

```bash
searchsploit -m exploits/php/webapps/35865.txt
```

### Examining the exploit

The disclosure date is September 1st 2015 so we're going to guess that the version we are working on is vulnerable. They specifically called out the target is Nibbleblog 4.0.3 which is our version. This is running metasploit though and this time we're trying to avoid using it. Let's just look at the blog post as referenced in the script and let's see if we can figure out how the exploit works.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/7-1.png)


### Explanation of exploit

We can find the explanation of the exploit [here](http://blog.curesec.com/article/blog/NibbleBlog-403-Code-Execution-47.html). If that link doesn't work try the [webarchive](https://web.archive.org/web/20191204234412/https://curesec.com/blog/article/blog/NibbleBlog-403-Code-Execution-47.html).

After uploading the file via the “My image” plugin, by default the server keeps the extension of the uploaded file. So all we have to do is find a way to upload images and then upload the file. Proof of Concept teaches us that this is a credentialed attack, we can't do it as an uncredentialed user. After activating a “My image plugin”, upload a shell. Finally visit the directory http://localhost/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/image.php. We have to find a way to log in. And to do that let's go back into Nibbleblog and look for potentially useful files.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/8-1.png)

If we go to admin.php on our target's IP... It's indeed the admin login page.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/8-2.png)


### Attempting to find valid usernames for Nibbleblog

We didn't find anything with index.php and the webpage but the webpage at install.php suggested us to update. We get two different files so let's try to go into them. It also exposes the version 4.0.3.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/9-1.png)


### Finding usernames in /content/private

This is a users directory with a users.xml file. User name “admin” and ID “0”, maybe. Some type of blacklist and an integer, but we don't know what the integer is. Let's try to use hydra and brute force the admin's password.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/10-2.png)


### Logged in, let's attempt our exploit!

Hydra gave us random results everytime and the situation was hopeless...

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/11-1.png)

On a whim, simpling entering "nibbles" as the password and voilà!

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/11-2.png)

We're in! So let's try to use the exploit mentionned earlier. We have the admin credentials. We just have to upload a file via the image plugin. Let's upload this file. The “GIF87” at the start of the file is just in case, it's going to help us just in case the server checks the beginning line of the file. The website gave us a bunch of error messages but the blog post said to ignore them.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/11-4.png)


### Code Execution achieved. Let's get a reverse shell.

We get image.php. Adding “?ipp=whoami” the server executed a command for us. Next let's try to find a reverse shell from pentest monkey cheatsheet to get in.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/12-2.png)


### Reverse shell returned

Python wasn't installed but Python3 is. We can use it to give us a tty.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/13-1.png)

Looking at the home directory we have user.txt. If we do wc -c user.txt we see it has 33 bytes. This is 32 characters for the MD5sum and then one for the line break. The very first thing we're going to do is sudo -l.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/13-2.png)


### Running sudo -l examine sudoer, then finding out why sudo took forever to return

Unable to resolve host name. For some reason sudo tries to resolve itself?

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/14-1.png)

Thanks to the /etc/hosts file we can see that this was Shocker's VM but it might have been updated to be Nibble's VM. That is why we have this error message because it tries to look up itself and can't. On the prevous command we see that the user nibbler may run the following command on Nibbles as root without a password: /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh. So let us just make that directory.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/14-2.png)


### Privesc via bad sudo rules

We made the directory and created the monitor.sh file. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/15-1.png)

After adding #!/bin/bash at the top of the file with vi, let's make it executable.

```bash
chmod u+x monitor.sh
```

Running the command took quite some time, it even timed out. But now we are root.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/24/nibbles/15-3.png)

We go to /root and see a root.txt. It's 33 bytes so that's probably our file :)
