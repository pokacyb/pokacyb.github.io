In last section, the LED module was the output part and RPI was the control part. Controlling the LED via the computer interface was a good learning experience but in practical situations we also want our device to sense the surrounding environment and then take appropriate actions. This time we will build a simple control system to light our LED through a push button switch. 
This is our Raspberry Pi as we left it [last time](https://pokacyb.github.io/raspi1-1/).

For this project we need to reorganize our breadboard. The LED state will be controlled through a push switch, that is when the button is pressed our LED will turn ON, when it is released the LED will turn OFF. This describes a [momentary switch](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-does-a-momentary-switch-work/).


![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/14/raspi2-1/2.jpg)


Let's jump to the code. We first need to read the state of the switch, and then determine to turn the LED ON in accordance to the state of the switch. The following is the program code: 

```C
#include <wiringPi.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define ledPin    0
#define buttonPin 1

void  main(void)
{
	printf("Program is starting ... \n");
	
	wiringPiSetup();
	
	pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
	pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);

	pullUpDnControl(buttonPin, PUD_UP);
	while(1){
		if(digitalRead(buttonPin) == LOW){
			digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
			printf("Button is pressed, led turned on >>>\n");
		}
		else {
			digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
			printf("Button is released, led turned off <<<\n");
		}
	}
}
```

It's hard to see on the above previous picture, but on the circuit LED and button are connected with GPIO17 and GPIO18 respectively, which correspond to 0 and 1 on wiringPi. Thats why we have:

```C
pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
````

In our while loop the function digitalRead(buttonPin) is used to determine the state of the button. When the button is pressed the function returns "LOW" and turns on the LED. If not the LED is OFF.

```C
	while(1){
		if(digitalRead(buttonPin) == LOW){
			digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
			printf("Button is pressed, led turned on >>>\n");
		}
		else {
			digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
			printf("Button is released, led turned off <<<\n");
		}
	}
```

That's it for today. Next time we will also use a push button switch but to make a to make a mini table lamp. See ya!
