Our first project in this Rasberry Pi Series is going to be a simple "Blink" project. We will use raspi to control the blinking of a common LED. 
Below is our raspi from last time, I already connected a GPIO extension board and a ribbon cable. The extension board is going to be handy for connecting the RPi I/O ports to the breadboard directly. Because the GPIO pin sequence on the extension board is identical to the GPIO pin sequence of the raspi.

The command ```gpio readall``` can help us visualize the GPIO pin connections. For documentation on pin definition of GPIO you can check <https://pinout.xyz/>.

We're then going to connect the LED, a resistor and two jumper cables to the breadboard.

The last step is going to require us to compile code. C code. This is doable in Python but I wanted to take the occasion to learn C. This will be the case for pretty much the entirety of this series. The code is from <https://freenove.com/>.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/07/raspi1-1/2b.png)


In the code above ```pinMode(int pin, int mode);``` sets the mode of a pin to either INPUT, OUTPUT, PWM_OUTPUT or GPIO_CLOCK. The other void function we want to look at is ```digitalWrite (int pin, int value);```, this writes the value HIGH or LOW (1 or 0) to the given pin, which must have been previously set as an output.

It's hard to see on the picture from earlier, but we connected the LED pin in the circuit as GPIO17 and GPIO17 is defined as 0 in the wiringPi numbering. That is why in ```#define ledPin 0 //define the led pin number``` ledPin is defined as 0.

In the main fonction main(), we initialize wiringPi first ```wiringPiSetup(); //Initialize wiringPi.```. The reference for wiringPi can be find [here](http://wiringpi.com/reference/).

After wiringPi is initialized, ledPIN is set to output mode and enters the while loop. That is the LED will keep blinking until stopped. The function digitalWrite alternatively sets the ouput of ledPin to HIGH (to turn ON) / LOW (to turn OFF), writes to the terminal and waits in between.

```C
	pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
	printf("Using pin%d\n",ledPin);
	while(1){
		digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); 
		printf("led turned on >>>\n");
		delay(1000);
		digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
		printf("led turned off <<<\n");
		delay(1000);
	}

```

Now let's compile the code and run the generated file "blink".

```bash
gcc Blink .c o Blink lwiringPi
sudo ./Blink
```

It is blinking indeed!

That's it for today. Next time we'll try to add some physical interactivity to our raspi. See ya.
