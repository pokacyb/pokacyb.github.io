I have been interested in Raspberry Pi development for a long time and so finally: I brought my first Raspberry Pi kit. The store name is Labists. There are a lot of starter kit for the raspi online but I found this one to be affordable and easy to set up. You can find the store here: <https://labists.com/>.

This will be a quick blog post (don't say unboxing). Since I'm missing some electronics to do some real building, we're just going to show to content of the kit and mount the box. This below is the actual Rasberry Pi 4 (model B).

And this is what came with the kit. The starter kit contains a power adapter, three heatsinks, a 32GB microSD, a fan, two HDMI cables, an USB card reader dongle, the Labists case and a screwdriver to add to my screwdriver collection. I don't really have a screwdriver collection, I just have a lot of screwdrivers.

First of all we're going to put on the three heatsinks. Be sure to aim right because once they're fixed it's pretty hard to move.

We're then going to screw the fan on one side of the box, and screw the raspi on the other. It fits allright, but it's obviously not official.

And done! Lighting it up, the fan doesn't make much noise and I was pleasantly suprised. You can choose a more powerful mode for the fan with the GPIO ports though.

This was a quick blog post to showcase the content of the Raspberry Pi starter kit from [Labists](https://labists.com/). Next time we're going to dive into electronics and do some basic LED stuff. See ya.
