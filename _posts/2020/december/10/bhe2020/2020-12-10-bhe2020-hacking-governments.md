_From December 9 to 10 I had the chance to assist to Black Hat Europe 2020, which was held online this year. There were a lot of interesting topics and brain racking questions being made. One in particular that made a strong impression on me was "Hacking Governments", a keynote leaded by Jeff Moss. 
In addition of being the founder of Black Hat and Defcon, Jeff has served as vice president and chief security officer at ICANN. He is an advisor with the US Homeland Security advisory council and a commissioner with the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace._

Jeff Moss states that they are four actors in our cyberspace:
- Organized criminals.
- Governments.
- Companies.
- Academic hackers and security researchers.

Organized criminals are mostly interested in how to make the most amount of money at the least amount of risk. You can see this trend in the way they are approching ransom ware.

Our second actor, governments, aren't monolithics like organized criminals can be. One part may be the intelligence agencies are interested in verying that other governments of the world are doing what they say they are doing. And to verify this, they may perform some clandestine online operations to steal some secrets. Is North Korea really complying with an arms control? Is Iran doing something  that it shouldn’t be doing? That’s traditional clandestine operations. But on the domestic front, the policy front, we see governments pursuing a handful of differents agendas. Are you allowed to hack your own TV? What’s the liability for an IoT device that burts into flame? Bio-medical liability for an implantable medical device? According to Jeff Moss there seems to be a lot of unanswered questions right now.

Where the answers to some of these policy debates are coming from the third community: companies. They are manufacturing the product, they are the ones that are building the infrastructure… They’re generally interested in maximizing return, but minimizing disruption, minimizing regulation, and minimizing embarrassment. They are the experts that build the product so they’re the ones that are mostly one scene in front of government lobbying to change a law.

The fourth community is that of the academic hacker and security researcher community. They’re the ones that are really interested in trying to figure out how do product work. What it really does, underneath the surface. Is it doing what the manufacturers claim and if it’s not they want to tell the world about it and through this very energized cyclical process. This disclosure later became commercial bug hunty programs. They act as sort of a neutral third-party telling policymakers what is and isn’t possible and this leads to tension. A tension between the researcher community and the government. 

On one hand the government wants to understand what’s possible. They need another voice to tell them something different that’s not coming from the lobbyists. But on the other hand if the way you’re coming up with that information may be violating copyright, that might be not acceptable. You can’t legislate based on stolen information for example. 
What do we do about this? We have historically moved more and more into the realm of policy. If you look at the trajectory of hackers and infosec over the last five to ten years, we are now providing that information. Policymakers have grown up with technology, computers, and are asking for opinion. This is a really dangerous time for the infosec community right now because they’re finally asking for opinion. Great opportunity, but also great risk: if we screw this up we might not be taken seriously. It’s very important that the community of the infosec researcher and the community of government learn from each other and learn how to work through this tension. Governments have been around since thousands of years. These technology researchers were pretty new and we’re not steeped in the ways of political navigation. The infosec community need to be cut a little slack but we also need to be guided and shown how to properly get the most out of our knowledge shared with policymakers.

If I had to take out something out of this introductory is Jeff Moss stance on the role of his community. Jeff seemed pretty excited of finally being heared by governments, but at the same time cautious in the steps to take. I think we can all learn from Jeff by being proud of our community and be concious of our responsability.
